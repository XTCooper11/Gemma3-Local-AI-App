## 🧠 About

**Gemma3 Local AI App** is a lightweight, privacy-first desktop application that lets you run the [Gemma3 model](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3) locally on your PC. Designed with simplicity in mind, this app offers an intuitive UI and system prompt customization — no cloud, no delay, just your own AI running directly on your machine.

It uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to run the LLM and a custom Python interface for local interaction. No internet connection required after setup.
